    "### Why we don't simply fit intertial signals to the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they showed relatively different trends between walking and stationary activity groups, we observed that most of the signals overlap within the same group activities. Hence, it's not clear whether they would be helpful for modelling activity detecting problem. Nevertheless, it's important to add that total acceleration signals showed considerable distinction even within the activities of same group. But, still, the total acceleration signals alone isn't enough to capture all the information about the event.\n",

    "### What we can do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the signal show similar behaviour (periodic patterns) over a period of time. It's important to find when this change happens. Thus, transforming signals between time and frequency domain, we try to decompose the frequency of these periodic components and later find possible significant peaks in frequency spectra. We'll use these concets:\n",
