    "### Why we don't simply fit intertial signals to the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they showed relatively different trends between walking and stationary activity groups, we observed that most of the signals overlap within the same group activities. Hence, it's not clear whether they would be helpful for modelling activity detecting problem. Nevertheless, it's important to add that total acceleration signals showed considerable distinction even within the activities of same group. But, still, the total acceleration signals alone isn't enough to capture all the information about the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we can do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the signal show similar behaviour (periodic patterns) over a period of time. From the initial investigation we did on inertial signals, we know that signal values change when activity changes at some moment and it shows similar flow during this activity. Especially, we observed some fluctuations or rapid changes at the signal values for some short frames in which transaction from one activity to another activity occurs. It's important to find when these changes happen. Thus, transforming signals between time and frequency domain, we'll try to decompose the frequency of these periodic components and later find possible significant peaks in frequency spectra. For this we'll use these concepts:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   1. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** - Used for finding frequency of periodical components\n",
    "   2. **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** - Finds peaks corrensponds to power distribution at that frequency\n",
    "   3. **Atocorrelation (aCORR)** - Caculates the serial correlation of a signal with its lagged signal\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   For  implemataion of these mehotds go to *'modules.SignalTransform'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is next now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have extra signals to conduct more detailed feature engineering which may convey better information. We'll use these transformation signals addition to initial inertial signals for doing feature extraction. Our total features set we'll be consist of features calculated on this newly created signal and those calculated on normal inertial signals.\n",
